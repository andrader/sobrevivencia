Data from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)

Description

A data frame of 2204 patients transplanted at the EBMT between 1995 and 1998. These data were used in Section 4 of the tutorial on competing risks and multi-state models (Putter, Fiocco & Geskus, 2007). The included variables are

id
Patient identification number

prtime
Time in days from transplantation to platelet recovery or last follow-up

prstat
Platelet recovery status; 1 = platelet recovery, 0 = censored

rfstime
Time in days from transplantation to relapse or death or last follow-up (relapse-free survival time)

rfsstat
Relapse-free survival status; 1 = relapsed or dead, 0 = censored

dissub
Disease subclassification; factor with levels "AML", "ALL", "CML"

age
Patient age at transplant; factor with levels "<=20", "20-40", ">40"

drmatch
Donor-recipient gender match; factor with levels "No gender mismatch", "Gender mismatch"

tcd
T-cell depletion; factor with levels "No TCD", "TCD"

Format

A data frame, see data.frame.
